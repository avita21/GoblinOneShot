H: Thanks for not...asking.
T: Opens, closes his mouth. I...didn't need to.
H: flinches, did I give away that much?
T: D-Don't worry, my assumptions are probably wrong.
</em>Yeah, right.</em>
T: Still...I appreciate you...sharing this much with me, Shindou.
H: Yeah, well, I felt like it, whatever okay? It's late isn't it? You should get home.
T: Alright. He walked to the door, pausing. Straightened his head and said, "Next time, you will not have it easy."

<h1>Hints of Summer</h1>

<p>The faint sound of a windchime whistled through Hikaru's open window, signaling the beginning of summer. Outside smells of sunbaked grass sauntered in, mixing with the smoky wisteria of his room, and caused Touya to sneeze. They had finished a game of speed go and the post-game discussion; the lazy air causing them to pause before diving into their next game. And maybe it was the fan on his dresser beckoning him, or the growing impulse to antagonize his rival once more, or the fragile awareness that maybe Touya won't press him too much on <em>why</em>, or...(and if he was honest) the upcoming anniversary that made him ask, "Hey, do you remember the first game we played?"</p>

<p>His rival's eyes flew to Hikaru's face in a suspicious glare. "Of course I do. Why?"</p>

<p>Hikaru's fingers gently touched the goban between them, as his mind wandered to the first time he entered Touya's salon, mouth invariably smiling at remembering their first meeting. "I don't." He gestured to the goban. "Want to replay it for me so I can?"</p>

<p>It took a great deal of effort for Hikaru to keep his grin from getting too pointed as Touya's face contorted from surprise to distrust to anger. <em>"You---you don't---!"</em> He could visibly see the thoughts in Touya's head: <em>I have replayed that game countless times and you---you forgot it! How, how dare...!</em> In response, Touya slammed the first black stone on the board, then the second, the third...</p>

<p>It wasn't like it was Hikaru's fault he didn't remember, <em>okay, it totally was, but,</em> he just...the only games he remembered from <em>then</em> were the ones Sai replayed and replayed for him and honestly, back then he was more interested in the second game with Touya, the one where Sai had to get serious. That first one took too long to hold his childish attention and he got enough of Sai's shidou-go already, so he never had him replay it. So he...forgot, or...more like he never cared to remember it...</p>

<p>A giggle blurted out of Hikaru, current thoughts scattered. "Wait wait wait, <em>Touya."</em></p>

<p>His rival paused in his aggressive placing of the stones. "What?" He arched his brow, daring Hikaru to comment.</p>

<p>So of course he did, eyes scanning the board. "You seriously thought that you would catch S-me like that?" Touya's eye's narrowed, and he quickly added, "Trying to set up a false eye so in three turns you could kill this hand," he pointed to the lower right corner of the board, "That's <em>so cute!"</em></p>  

<p>"Hmph." Touya's face reddened gloriously. "If you did this to ridicule my go, then we are replaying our third match after this." He slammed the next stone down hard.</p>

<p><em>Ulp...</em>He could feel the burning questions Touya would ask having those two games played back to back...He didn't want to add more fuel to the fire, but....he glanced back down to the forceful beat of stone playing around with stone on the board, of Sai's hands teasing and teaching Touya's. Warmth flooded his heart at this banter between the two greatest influences on his life. "F-Fine, but only if I get to replay our second match afterwards."</p>

<p>Touya scowled, seeing right through him. "Agreed." His placement slowed, becoming less aggressive as they both turned more melancholy looking at the game, though Touya's frown never left his face.</p>

<p>Hikaru tried to pay attention to the game, swallowing the rush of emotion that always accompanied remembering Sai's plays. But he couldn't help taking a quick break, and watch Touya instead, hunched over the board, glaring at it like he could disintegrate his immature hands with his mind. <em>This shouldn't be that painful for him...</em> Hikaru put on a wide smile and said, "Can you believe this was you, what, five years ago? It's kind of disappointing, really. Look at how much innocence you've lost! There's no getting that back now."</p>

<p>"It was six years, two months ago." He placed <em>that</em> black stone in the upper left corner of the board, and Hikaru forced himself not to turn and look over his shoulder, not to expect Sai's happy grin shielded with his fan as he waited in anticipation for how Touya would respond. He stood perfectly still, face blank, waiting for his rival to continue placing stones. Touya sighed, staring at Hikaru, the question they'd both been avoiding on his lips---<em>And what of your change?---</em>but he said, "At least you grew out of this antiquated style."</p>

<p>Hikaru swallowed again, trying to let that wash over him, unaffected. "Yeah, well...it was my first game. Of course I'd pick up the new way of doing things as I played more." He sat straighter, an arsenal of bullshit at his fingertips for any other questions Touya would throw at him.</p>

<p>Touya glanced down at the goban, placing stones again, hiding his small smile. "That was the truth."</p>

<p><em>Why can't he be less perceptive?</em></p>

<p>Touya said, "You're right, I will never underestimate an arrogant kid who doesn't even hold the stones correctly again." He slyly grinned, obviously remembering Hikaru's past official matches where he had to use more unconventional methods of placing stones thanks to the scars on his hands. "Although, I doubt anyone would, now."</p>

<p>His hands twinged with the attention. "It, it has gotten better...I can probably last a match holding them right now..."</p>

<p>Touya looked at him, unbelieving. The last few stones made it onto the board, Sai's playful shidou-go staring back at him. "Happy now?" Hikaru's eyes trailed the dancing black stones surrounding Touya's white, Sai's elegant counters to his rival's hands.</p>

<p>"Actually, yes." The wind blew through the window again, fluttering the kifu on his wall. "I can finally record this now."</p>

<p>Touya fidgeted awkwardly, before blurting, "W-Well...would you like me to? Since..."</p>

<p>"Nah," he pointed to his head. "It's in here, so...once I get better, I'll do it."</p>

<p>"If you must." He began clearing the goban as Hikaru silently said goodbye to the game. Once it was cleared, Touya arched a brow, waiting. "Don't tell me you forgot this one too."</p>

<p>"Yup! Completely forgotten, since only the weak remember their defeats." He was greeted with a two second eye roll, <em>a beautiful success,</em> before Hikaru held his hand out. "Give me the goke and I'll do it."</p>

<p>"Just call it out."</p>

<p>It was Hikaru's turn to roll his eyes. "Mother hens. All of you. Fine." He watched Touya becoming increasingly perplexed as he called out the positions, the strength of the initial hands suddenly becoming pitiful, naive, a joke. He refused to pause, wanting to get this over quickly. It ended quickly.</p>

<p>His rival shook his head, still frowning, probably shoving aside the old feelings of how one could go from playing go <em>like that</em> to <em>this.</em> Touya twisted a stone in his fingers, and sighed again. "This wasn't as satisfying as I thought it would be."</p>

<p>"What? No snarky remark on my go? On my arrogance that at this skill, I thought I could take you on? That our skills weren't <em>that</em> far off? That I thought---" He clamped his mouth down on that remark.</p>

<p>"Shindou, what..." Touya also stopped, certain that a question would drive Hikaru off. Instead, he took the stones off in reverse order, restoring the game to its mid point. The black stone tapped the goban, and he waited for Hikaru to look at him. "11-8. It was after this, that..."</p>

<p>"That you could finally see who I truly was."</p>

<p>"No." Touya pointed to the stone. "11-8 was the start of something else. A hand that you could not pull off <em>then."</em></p>

<p>The <em>but now?</em> implied. Hikaru huffed, not over this ridiculousness, "What, you want me to...?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" He looked his most arrogant, beckoning and daring him to agree.</p>

<p>"You just want to avoid replaying our second game, admit it."</p>

<p>Touya pretended to deflate, murmuring, "Hm, perhaps I was wrong, you aren't skilled enough to play it after all."</p>

<p><em>"What, of course I am,"</em> He squinted at Touya, giving in. "Gah, whatever. You don't know what you're getting into here. 10-9."</p>

<p>Touya responded accordingly and the game was on. This time, Hikaru saw the wisps of formations Sai had set up, and could finally complete them...well, when Touya let him. But he couldn't play as Sai, of course not, <em>especially not like this,</em> so if the formations turned more savage and sneaky than what <em>he</em> would've planned, Touya didn't complain. In fact, he matched his style, even turning it up as he morphed his childish hands into something sharp and biting, almost ruining the 11-8 hand completely. <em>But I'm not done yet, you bastard.</em> He called out the next position and watched as Touya placed the stone, then bit his lip in concentration. <em>Hah! Take that!</em></p>

<p>Touya soon countered, and the game went into a ruthless yose. Once they both passed, they stared at the complex dance on the goban, no apparent winner. Hikaru couldn't swallow around the lump of tears and smiles stuck in his throat as he gazed at the mix of his and Sai's styles, like it was Sai sending him off, supporting him like he always did, and even when he was gone, when it was all Hikaru's plays, he was still there, always with Hikaru, always in Hikaru's go. "Shindou?" Touya looked at him, concerned. <em>Oh.</em> His hands touched his face, feeling tears. He wiped his eyes with his sleeve.</p>

<p>"I'm fine." He stopped crying. "Who won?"</p>

<p>Touya decided to let him off easy and crossed his arms, dryly saying, "You did by half a moku."</p>

<p>He glanced back at the board. "Huh, so I did..." A shaky grin emerged on his mouth. "Think you could salvage our second match? I'll even let you place an extra three stones from when you resigned."</p>

<p>Touya's eyes widened, as he began whispering strategies to himself, too fast and broken for Hikaru to keep up. "Make it four stones, and I'll win it."</p>

<p>His curiosity overruled any sense and so he agreed, watching Touya clear the board, still muttering to himself. "Uh, no post-game discussion?"</p>

<p>"You don't seem up for it, we'll discuss it next time." The board cleared, and Touya began setting up their second game, pausing at the point of his former resignation. His fingers rhythmically tapped his knee as he reviewed his newfound strategy, confirming it with a nod, and placed four white stones down. He looked up at Hikaru with a gleeful glint in his eyes that said, "Your turn."</p>

<p><em>Interesting...</em> Touya was still openly taunting him as well as one could in a proper seiza position. <em>Do I give him a chance, to see how he will come back? Or...</em> He stared at the point that would cut off his advance. <em>Do I shut this down right now? But...wait,</em> the more he stared at that cutting point, the more it seemed like Touya deliberately set it up for him. He closed his eyes softly laughing, <em>Wow, Sai...I know exactly how you felt in the beginning here, and of course the only answer is,</em> he opened his eyes, called out the point, and let the game capture his thoughts.</p>

<p>It progressed very differently than the previous one, this time they were both cautious, taking longer pauses between moves, so much so that by the time yose came around again, they had to turn on the light as the cool night air streamed through, causing Hikaru to shiver. When it was finally over, Hikaru yawned and stretched his arms out. "Damn, I really didn't think you could come that close," the game ended with Hikaru's two moku win, "still, Touya, that was pretty amazing."</p>

<p>He was treated to a rare yawn from his rival, as he replied, "It was...more fun than I expected, a rather different feel than starting with a handicap..." He lasped into silent pondering, as if he was trying to remember past games where---</p>

<p>"Don't tell me you want to do this again? With games where we were thoroughly trashed by our opponent? Do you eevn have many of those?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do," he said like it was the most obvious thing in the world. "I live with a former Meijin."</p>

<p><em>Ah, right.</em></p>

<p>Touya dismissively added, "And I know you have games like that---"</p>

<p><em>"---Hey!"</em></p>

<p>"So, yes. I think this would be good practice for us." He cleaned up the board again, and it was easy for Hikaru to end his token protest and agree, but before he could voice it, Touya's stomach growled, and they both became intensely aware of the smells wafting from downstairs.</p>

<p>"Want to stay for dinner? I think my mom must've made more for you, and..." he gathered his thoughts together, trying to steel himself from further emotional outbursts, "we, we could discuss the game afterwards? Both games." He scoffed at Touya's surprised look. "Don't gimme that, I told you I'm fine. C'mon." He stood up, making his way to the door as Touya followed suit, pausing before leaving the room.</p>

<p>"If you're certain, then I will accept." He looked uncertain, uncomfortably scratching his elbow as he opened his mouth then immediately closed it as he stepped out of the room.</p>

<p>Hikaru sighed, "Just say it Touya."</p>

<p>"Well..." He didn't meet his eyes as he cautiously said, "I wanted to...thank you. For...sharing this with me."</p>

<p>Hikaru flinched, panicking. "S-Sharing what? I didn't---you never asked---"</p>

<p>"I didn't need to," he said quietly. The implications of <em>that</em> flooded Hikaru's senses, paralyzing him as Touya quickly added, "Don't worry, my assumptions are probably wrong."</p>

<p><em>Yeah, right.</em></p>

<p>He glanced back at Touya, a vision of tortured regret, cursing himself for saying anything, and bit back another sigh, instead scrunching his forehead with his palm. "W-Well, whatever, I wanted to okay? A-Anyway, c'mon. I'm starving." He turned and went down the stairs, hearing Touya follow. "And, hey, this means I get to continue my win streak soon!"</p>

<p>Touya didn't bother to deign that with a response. He did, however, quickly roll his eyes--so fast that Hikaru barely caught it, but he did and that meant--<em>that was twice! In one day! A new record!</em> He let it lift his mood a bit as they both made their way to the dinner table after Touya's gracious thank you to his mom, both eagerly awaiting their next match.</p>
